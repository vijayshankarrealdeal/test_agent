Differences between WhatsApp Business App vs WhatsApp Business API Before we go deeper into the topic, let me quickly explain the main differences between the WhatsApp Business App and the WhatsApp Business API in simple words. We'll compare WhatsApp Business App and WhatsApp Business Platform (API) based on a number of factors: Designed For WhatsApp Business App is designed for small businesses and can handle only a few customer conversations. It's easy to use and doesn't cost anything. On the flip side, WhatsApp Business Platform (API) is meant for bigger businesses with dedicated teams managing large customer communications.

On the other hand, WhatsApp Business Platform (API) can send broadcasts to any number of people depending upon your tier level. That is a different concept though. Moreover, the reach of WhatsApp Business App broadcasts is limited to those who have saved the business number in their contacts. But with WhatsApp Business Platform (API), there are no such restrictions, and the messages can reach anyone. Team Inbox In WhatsApp Business App, it's not simple to share your inbox with team members. You can try using WhatsApp Web, but it has some drawbacks. For example, if someone gets logged out, you need to help them log back in. Also, you won't know who replied to a message, and it's challenging to see which conversations have been handled.

This means partner services cannot offer this feature. However, don't worry! You can still make voice calls using your phone's regular phone services with the same WhatsApp Business number. Multi User Access WhatsApp Business App can only be installed on one phone, but you can use WhatsApp Web on up to 4 devices to access it.
